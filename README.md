This library contains material/algorithms etc. that are posted online (mostly through online courses, blogs, books) and I find particular interesting.

<h2>Algorithms<h2>

Algoritmic implementations: https://github.com/kennyledet/Algorithm-Implementations

The master of algorithms repository in many languages:
http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code

A lot of basic algorithms are implemeted hereas a part of a CS book in Java This is actually awesome). Data structures and basic algorihms are implemented by the book authors:
